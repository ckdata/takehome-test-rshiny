# Take Home Test: R/Shiny
**Length:** Three hours

In this repository you can find a CSV, `content_library_anonymised.csv`. This contains a small subset anonymised customer advertising data. There are 652 rows and 30 columns, ranging from the standard identifying columns (e.g.: `id`, `Ad.Account.Anonymised`), to numeric variables (e.g. `Cost` in Euros, `Impressions`) and categorical variables (`Which.category.fits.best.for.this.creative.`, `What.about.the.person.s...gender.` ). 

Your task is to to take a look through this data, find something interesting and build an R/Shiny app to showcase that. This could be a surprising link between two variables, a cool way of visualising how clients are spending their money, predicting performance of future adverts or something different entirely. 

You'll be assessed on...
* Creativity! We're interested in seeing a functional app that uses the data set in an interesting way
* Functionality â€“ this is the most important thing, what the app is capable of doing
* Code style & quality
* Use of Git - commits, pull requests, etc. 
* Appearance - if you have time to polish up the looks

Once you're done, either create a pull request on the repository directly or zip up your file and let carlos@cosmonautsandkings.com and joshua@cosmonautsandkings.com know. 

### Some tips
* Use whatever packages and libraries you like and feel most confident with
* Don't worry too much about making sure your findings are 100% solid - we won't be using this for anything else and it's more about showing off what you're capable of

_Note: Please *DON'T* spend more than three hours on this, tops. If you can do it in less time, awesome, if not, then just submit how far you got and that's perfect too._
