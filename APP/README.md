# Advertisement Dashboard

I have completed the dashboard as per the allocated time of 3 hrs. However, due to time constraint I missed out revising some formating issues and adding extra panel for describing the dashboard, so below I will be adding a bit of information about it.   

[Click here to view the Dashboard](https://rishabh-kanojia.shinyapps.io/AdDash/)

- It consist of 3 User inputs viz. Year, Accounts and Created Ad Category, which can be used to analyse the data on various parameters.
- It has counters for showing major facts about the advertisement data.
- I added the comparison between Impressions with Ad Created Category and CTA type as well as a wordcloud for highlighting the main topic of the advertisement created by accounts.

& a little more info is there..  

Thank You!!
